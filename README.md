This will eventually be a VFR flight planner that uses free FAA assets. Currently, you can open and view charts (zipped geotiff). You can also open NASR data files (zipped CSV) in order to search for airports.

Charts can be downloaded [here](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/).
NASR files can be downloaded [here](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/NASR_Subscription/).
