This will eventually be a VFR flight planner that uses free FAA assets. Currently, you can open and view [charts](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/) (zipped GEO-TIFF). You can also open [NASR data files](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/NASR_Subscription/) (zipped CSV) in order to search for airports.
