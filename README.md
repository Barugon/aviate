This will eventually be a VFR flight planner that uses free FAA assets. Currently, you can open and view [charts](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/) (zipped GEO-TIFF). You can also open the [NASR 28 day subscription](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/NASR_Subscription/) zip file in order to search for airports.

Compiling with `--features=mobile` will exclude window decorations and recenter the chart when the keyboard is shown/hidden or when the screen is rotated.
