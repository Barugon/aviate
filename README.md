This will eventually be a VFR flight planner that uses free FAA assets. Currently, you can open and view [charts](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/) (zipped GEO-TIFF). You can also open [NASR data files](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/NASR_Subscription/) (zipped CSV) in order to search for airports.

If running on a device like PinePhone or Librem 5 then use the command line parameter `--no-deco` in order to remove window decorations.

> NOTE: use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to zoom or the buttons at the upper right. Pinch-zoom currently does not work.
